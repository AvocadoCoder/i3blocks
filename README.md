# i3blocks

This is where I upload my i3blocks scripts. I try to make them as minimallistic and redeable as posible, so they are so suitable for begguinners.


# Battery

This is what shows the battery state in the i3blocks bar and send notifications via notify-send when the battery is getting lower, when the power supply is plugged or the battery is full. It uses an archive called battery-notification-status as flag for the script to know when to send notifications or not.
