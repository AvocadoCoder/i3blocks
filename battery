# "on" don't. This is because the Full status comes straight from the Charguing status, so the archive is set to "off" before the
# Full status appear.

#
#
#
#
#
#
# This is how it implemented in i3blocks config
#
# [battery]
# interval=5
#
#
# Bug report:
#
#### Sometimes if percentage or status change, for example, you plug the Power Supply or the percentage goes down, just when the i3blocks
# re-runs the script, time may be bugged and show domething a little bit strange lilke 3454:00:00 till shutdown, this is because the acpi
# -b command calculates worng the remaining time just when something changes
#
#### Sometimes you my see some strange percentage and "Unknown" as status, it's fixed whenever it actualices, it happens with most battery
# scripts I've used before, I guess when yÂ¡something changes, it last a little to realise what happened.
